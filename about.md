I am Chathura Kulasinghe, a professional attached to solutions architecture with 18 years of experience in the industry, spanning software development and solution architecture. Over the years, I have been involved in designing and developing software applications and platforms using both commercial and open-source technologies. I enjoy simplifying complex technical problems and making them more accessible through visuals and storytelling. My usual approach focuses on breaking down challenges into clear, diagrammatic representations that help teams find solutionsâ€”with the use of whiteboarding and simple illustrations to bridge communication gaps, ensuring that people from different backgrounds and technical levels can connect and collaborate with ease. With this blog, I intend to continue this effort by sharing relevant content that helps make complex ideas easier to understand and apply.
